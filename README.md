# Climate Cues
Climate Cues is a weather forecast web application that features a weather widget that displays current weather information with a dynamic background. It consists of three data visualization charts: a vertical bar chart, a doughnut chart, and a line graph. A five-day weather forecast table with pagination presents the temperature forecast.
